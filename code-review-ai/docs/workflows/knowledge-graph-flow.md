# Knowledge Graph Flow

Prompt generation for knowledge-graph weighting and relation evaluation is centralized under `app/prompts/knowledge_graph/`.

## Overview

The knowledge-graph flow is split into small APIs so graph state can be written and validated incrementally.

## Curriculum Setup Flow

1. Upsert concepts with `PUT /api/v1/knowledgegraph/concepts/{concept_id}`
2. Upsert exercises with `PUT /api/v1/knowledgegraph/exercises/{exercise_id}`
3. Relation inputs are passed as ids only, not nested entity payloads
4. The API validates that every related concept and exercise already exists in Neo4j
5. The knowledge-graph LLM evaluates `TESTS.weight`, selects `RECOMMENDED_FOR.path`, scores `RECOMMENDED_FOR.weight`, and evaluates `RELATED_TO.weight` from the resolved graph entities
6. The repository rebuilds weighted `TESTS`, `RECOMMENDED_FOR`, and `RELATED_TO` links for the main exercise

## Student Setup Flow

1. Upsert a student profile with `PUT /api/v1/knowledgegraph/students/{student_id}`
2. Store normalized learner-level profile scores on the `Student` node

## Submission And Review Flow

1. Upsert a submission with `PUT /api/v1/knowledgegraph/submissions/{submission_id}`
2. The submission API validates that `Student` and `Exercise` already exist
3. The submission API refreshes `SUBMITTED`, `FOR_EXERCISE`, and `NEXT_ATTEMPT` relations
4. Upsert a review with `PUT /api/v1/knowledgegraph/reviews/{review_id}`
5. The review API validates that the referenced `Submission` exists and overwrites the stored review fields from the request
6. Review relations are refreshed to match the linked student, submission, exercise, and adjacent review-history chain

## Read Flow

1. `GET /api/v1/knowledgegraph` returns the current graph snapshot
2. recommendation services query the repository directly for targeted context

## Why This Split Helps

- easier validation at each write step
- clearer ownership of graph entities
- fewer oversized payloads
- simpler debugging when graph state is inconsistent

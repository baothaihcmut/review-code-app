# Domain Docs

This folder contains stable domain concepts that multiple APIs and workflows depend on.

## Use This Folder When

- you need to understand what a model means, not just how an API is shaped
- you need to reason about graph relations or recommendation signals
- you are changing storage, recommendation ranking, or profile scoring logic
